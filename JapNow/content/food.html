       Japanese cuisine is the food—ingredients, preparation and way of eating—of Japan. 
       Such traditional food of Japan is normally rice with miso soup and other dishes, 
       each in its own utensil, with an emphasis on seasons. The side dishes often 
       consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Fish is common in the 
       traditional Japanese cuisine as it is most abundant. Although often grilled,  it may also be served 
       raw as sashimi or in sushi. Here, you will find some popular dishes.
